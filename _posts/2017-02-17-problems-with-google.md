### TL;DR Most people use Google, but they do not realize what happens with their data once their search is done.

According to Alexa, "Google.com" is the most visited website on the world wide web. To have earned this title it is clear that people use Google from their basic questions, to their e-mails, to their cravings for cute animals videos. But one thing people probably do not think about is "what happens after the search is over?"

Have you ever searched for shoes and a few hours later saw the same shoes as an ad on Facebook? This is an example of data mining. The dictionary definition of data mining is, "The practice of examining large databases in order to generate new information", but the real world definition translates to websites remembering what you were looking at so the next time you sign on they can show you more of what you like. This is the primary focus of the online retail market. For example, when shopping on Amazon, if you had purchase something it keeps record of this data so the next time you log on similar items are more liable to appear.  

For people who worry about their privacy the legality of data mining comes as an alarming truth. Instead of the United States government having laws to protect citizens from data mining the government actually uses data mining. According to Harvard Law, "Government agencies have long made use of subject-based, relational, and data matching searches"(Government Data Mining). But it gets worse, in 2004 the General Accounting Office recorded that forty-two departments were engaging in or planned on engaging in "data mining efforts involving personal information" (Government Data Mining). This might sound like it is violating Fourth Amendment Constitutional rights, but the Supreme Court has ruled that if information has been "obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court has consistently found that the Fourth Amendment imposes no independent duty to refrain from using it" ( Government Data Mining). This unfortunately means that there are not many laws protecting individuals' data from being used.

Data mining still does not feel right despite its legality. One argument around data mining comes from an ethics stand point. Whither data mining comes from a business or a government stand point, they use data mining for their own gains.
