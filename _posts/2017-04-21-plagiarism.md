### TL;DR Most everyone believes that Plagiarism is wrong, yet students see plagiarism around them in media and even from their professors.

Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work or thoughts without giving them proper credit. Any student knows that plagiarism is wrong and has serious consequences, yet students see plagiarism happen to them all of the time. For example, plagiarism appear often in the music industry. Also, in my personal experience I have seen educators plagiarize their worksheets and their tests. How are the students expected to do their own work when everyone around them is plagiarizing?

Plagiarism has become a frequent problem in the music industry. Two songs that caught my attention are *Ice Ice Baby* by Vanilla Ice and *Under Pressure* by Queen and David Bowie. Since these songs come from two different genres how are they related? The answer is that they have the same baseline.
