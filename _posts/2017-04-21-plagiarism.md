### TL;DR Most everyone believes that Plagiarism is wrong, yet students see plagiarism around them in media and even from their professors.

Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work or thoughts without giving them proper credit. On one hand, every student knows that plagiarism is wrong and has serious consequences. On the other hand, students see plagiarism happen around them all of the time. For example, plagiarism appear often in the music industry. Also, in my personal experience I have seen educators plagiarize their worksheets and their quizzes. How are the students expected to do their own work when everyone around them is plagiarizing?

Plagiarism has become a frequent problem in the music industry. Two songs that caught my attention are *Ice Ice Baby* by Vanilla Ice and *Under Pressure* by Queen and David Bowie. Since these songs come from two different genres how are they related? The answer is that they have the exact same baseline. *Under Pressure* was released in 1981, which *Ice Ice Baby* was released in 1990, so it is clear who plagiarized whom. Although this is an extreme case since both songs have the same base line, plagiarism still occurs in modern music, including those that hit number 1 on The Billboard Hot 100. According to Billboard.com two Number 1 songs accused of plagiarism of this century included Robin Thicke's *Blurred Lines* and Coldplay's *Viva la Vida* (Lynch). In all three cases the parties plagiarizing ended up paying royalties to those who they plagiarized (Lynch). Although those caught plagiarizing ended up paying for their actions, the message they are sending to their listeners is not a positive one. Robin Thicke and Coldplay listeners are typically still in school, which gives students the opportunity to plagiarize while also not learning why they should not plagiarize.

Educators are often perceived as being people that students can look up to, but this is not always the case. For example, often times teachers or professors will make students take quizzes that the educators make the illusion that they created it, yet I have found this to be untrue. Earlier in the semester my roommate and I were assigned a take-home quiz. After I completed the quiz my roommate told me that she was able to find all of the answers online. I was puzzled until I look for myself. After I searched for one of the test questions, I found a page that had the question verbatim. I clicked on the link and to my surprise not only were most of the questions on this website but the answer choices were verbatim and appeared in the same order as they did on my quiz. The data on the top of the quiz I found online was from Spring of 2009, which is eight years before I took this quiz. My professor copied a quiz without giving any credit to the professor who made the quiz. If any student had done this with a paper or presentation they would be in bad academic standings with the school and might even be worried if they would be suspended. I think we should be looking at professors and holding them to the same accountability that students are held to. Students look up to the professors, and this does not give students the right guidance.

The problem of plagiarism keeps getting worse. According to *The New York Times*, "Studies of student behavior and attitudes show that a majority of students violate standards of academic integrity to some degree, and that high achievers are just as likely to do it as others. Moreover, there is evidence that the problem has worsened over the last few decades" (Perez-Pena). Although, plagiarism is being seen more frequently in pop culture and even in the classroom, students are still the ones that need to care and take pride in the work that they are doing. Often times students are unaware of the plagiarism policies at their institution(Perez-Pena). One way to prevent plagiarism is to educate students on what is considered plagiarism and why it is harmful. Despite plagiarism being around students the way to end it is to educate them on the matter.
