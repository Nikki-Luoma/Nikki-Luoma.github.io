### TL;DR The Internet has made our lives easier, and it has made criminals out of most people.

Often times people browse the Internet without thinking of any of their consequence because of the anonymity that the Internet gives us. This anonymous feeling that the Internet can be useful by allowing people to share thoughts that they normally would not but, it also allows for people to do things that they would not normally do, such as break the law. One example of this is cyber bullying, which is illegal in most states. The Internet has now allowed for students to have endless information at their fingertips, which has caused an increase in plagiarism. Another example of digital stealing is piracy, which has gained popularity with the Internet. Lastly, when people use the Internet their morals seem to disappear. For example, some people use ad blocker, which can be considered stealing revenue from websites.
