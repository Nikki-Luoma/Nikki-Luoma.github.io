### TL;DR The Internet has made our lives easier, and it has made criminals out of most people.

Often times people browse the Internet without thinking of any of their consequence because of the anonymity that the Internet gives us. This anonymous feeling that the Internet can be useful by allowing people to share thoughts that they normally would not but, it also allows for people to do things that they would not normally do, such as break the law. One example of this is cyber bullying, which is illegal in most states. The Internet has now allowed for students to have endless information at their fingertips, which has caused an increase in plagiarism. Another example of digital stealing is piracy, which has gained popularity with the Internet. Lastly, when people use the Internet their morals seem to disappear. For example, some people use ad blocker, which can be considered stealing revenue from websites.

Most high schools have a "zero tolerance" policy on bullying, yet cyber bullying has gained in popularity. One reason that cyber bullying is so prevalent is because it allows students to hide behind their computer screen and say things that they normally would not say to someone in person. Although there are some laws that are against cyber bullying there are no federal laws against cyber bullying (stop bullying). Despite cyber bullying having the same effect as regular bullying, some states do not have laws or bullying policies that protect the victim when they are off campus, for example online. Despite there being "laws" against cyber bullying it is prevalent because there are not as many laws on the punishment. According to "Stop bullying.gov" there are not any Pennsylvania laws that state that the bully will receive any punishment, which shows there are not consequences for cyber bullying.

Cyber bullying is not the only crime that happens on school property. Plagiarism is an academic crime that has sparked with the growth of the Internet.
