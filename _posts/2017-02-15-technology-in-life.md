### TL;DR Online shopping has allowed us to have the most useless items in our hands in a matter of days.




Technology has evolved in the past few decades. In the matter of several years, we went from not being able to be on the internet and telephone at the same time to being able to have virtually everything at our finger tips. One of the major things that has evolved because of this is retail. Just a few years ago, if you wanted something you had three options: drive around nearby shopping centers to see if they carried it and hope it was in stock, order it from a catalog and wait six to eight weeks for it to come in, or simply go without said item. Luckily things have changed. There has been an explosion of websites that specialize in on-line shopping not to mention that almost every store has a website for convenient at home shopping. While this is a nice luxury to have, why does it matter?

I am an avid softball player who lives an hour away from the nearest sporting goods store. Often times during my long season my equipment would wear out. The typical length of my season was from spring to fall. Since my seasons were so long, I would run into the problem that sporting goods stores would have moved onto a different season and would no longer carry the equipment that I needed. While I was playing my two options would amount to asking my dad to drive me around hoping we could find equipment that I wanted or I could just order it on-line. Of course my dad enjoys spending time with me but scraping an entire day to buy socks was not the best use of our time.

This is not the only way that I use online shopping. As a college student I spent a lot of my time avoiding doing my homework. Through the process of procrastination one of my favorite past times include random searches on Amazon. One of my most infamous buys includes a a great deal I could not resist, a pack of 50 DS styluses for $5. Obviously, for several reasons this deal could not be found in stores. Without the use of the internet I would not have been able to find such a useless item.

One of my biggest problems is that I support a sports team outside of its region. I am a Cleveland Indians fan, this is unfortunate for a couple reasons, one of which is that where I am from an area that only sells Pittsburgh Pirates gear. The two options that are presented to me are I could go to Ohio and search a few sports stores and hope that they have what I am looking for, or I could search Amazon and see what I find. Of course, I could easily live my life without spending money on useless items, but as of today I am awaiting a Cleveland Indians bat to place in my room.

Online shopping has changed the face of retail. Before shopping most people would have to give up hours of their day in order to find something small and essentially useless. Since online shopping has become faster, cheaper and easier many people have started to utilize it such as myself. Not to mention there are many items you can find online that cannot be found in most local stores. Since most website now offer fast shipping that is also free it makes more sense to use online websites as opposed to the physical store, since most of the time I do not need an item this second. The next time you want something, instead of hunting around town for it, try to find it online.
