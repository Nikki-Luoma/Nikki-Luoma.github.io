### TL;DR Online shopping has allowed us to have the most useless items in our hands in a matter of days.




Technology has evolved in the past few decades. In the matter of several years we went from not being able to be on the internet and the telephone at the same time, to being able to have virtually everything at our finger tips. One of the major things that has evolved because of this is retail.  Just a few years ago if you wanted something you had three options, drive around nearby shopping centers to see if they carried it and hope it was in stock, order it from a catalog and wait six to eight weeks for it to come in, or simply go without said item. Luckily things have changed. There have been an explosion of websites that specialize in on-line shopping not to mention that almost every store has a website for convenient at home shopping. While this is a nice luxury to have, why does it matter?

I am an avid softball player, who lives an hour away from the nearest sporting goods store. Often times during my long season where my equipment would wear out. Growing up my two options would amount to asking my dad to drive me around hoping we could find equipment that I wanted or I could just order it on-line. Of course my dad enjoys spending time with me but scraping an entire day to buy socks was not the best use of our time.
