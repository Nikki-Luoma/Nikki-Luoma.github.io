### TL;DR Online shopping has allowed us to have the most useless items in our hands in a matter of days.




Technology has evolved in the past few decades. In the matter of several years we went from not being able to be on the internet and the telephone at the same time, to being able to have virtually everything at our finger tips. One of the major things that has evolved because of this is retail.  Just a few years ago if you wanted something you had three options, drive around nearby shopping centers to see if they carried it and hope it was in stock, order it from a catalog and wait six to eight weeks for it to come in, or simply go without said item.

Of course internet shopping has helped many people buy their essential items such as medicine supplies, house hold appliances and of course food from foreign lands.
