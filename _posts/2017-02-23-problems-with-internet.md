### TL;DR Most people do not realize what happens with their data once their search is complete.

The Internet is a relatively new technology, and the one thing people probably do not think about is "what happens to my data after my search is done." When the search is over, companies often collect user data, this is a prime example of data mining. This tool has its perks from the users' standpoint such as the ability to be shown more things that they like. Although this might sound nice, there is talk about the negative effects of data mining. Two of the major questions surrounding data mining are privacy issues and ethical issues. Despite these problems people continue to search without thinking about the consequence.

Have you ever searched for shoes and a few hours later saw the same shoes as an ad on Facebook? This is an example of data mining. The dictionary definition of data mining is, "The practice of examining large databases in order to generate new information", but the real world definition translates to websites remembering what you were looking at so the next time you sign on they can show you more of what you like. This is the primary focus of the online retail market. For example, when shopping on Amazon, if you had purchased something it keeps record of this data so the next time you log on similar items are more liable to appear.  

For people who worry about their privacy the legality of data mining comes as an alarming truth. Instead of the United States government having laws to protect citizens from data mining, they are known to use data mining. According to Harvard Law, "Government agencies have long made use of subject-based, relational, and data matching searches" (Government Data Mining). But it gets worse, in 2004 the General Accounting Office recorded that forty-two departments were engaging in or planned on engaging in "data mining efforts involving personal information" (Government Data Mining). This might sound like it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, but the Supreme Court has ruled that if information has been "obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment,the Supreme Court has consistently found that the Fourth Amendment imposes no independent duty to refrain from using it" (Government Data Mining). This unfortunately means that there are not many laws protecting individuals' data from being used.

Data mining still does not feel right despite its legality. One argument around data mining comes from an ethics stand point. Whether data mining comes from a business or a government stand point, they use data mining for their own gains. One of the issues that users do not check are the "Terms and Agreements", which are the rules of the website. Of course the user should want to know the rules before using the website, but businesses know how to get around this. Most of the time the "Terms and Agreements" are too long to read. For example, the terms and conditions for iTunes is over 6,000 words which would take the average individual over 20 minutes to read (Apple). The problem with any ethics argument is that all data mining activity is explicitly presented to the user. Looking at the previous example, under Apple's "Privacy Policy" page it states, "We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, MAC App Store, App Store for Apple TV and, iBooks Stores and, from our other products and services" (Privacy). Apple is not the only company that has their terms listed, other major companies such as Google and Amazon explicitly state what the terms are of using their sites. Even if data mining is not the most ethical way to look at user data, the user has agreed to these terms by using the service and checking the button that states they have "Read and Accepted" theres terms.

Since data mining is a useful method for many businesses to obtain users' information, it does not appear to be going away anytime soon. If a user is concerned with what happens to their data there are a few actions that they can take. The first thing the user should do is make sure that they are aware and agree with the terms and conditions. If one does not agree with the terms of conditions they should not use that website. Also, the user should check their settings on their Internet browser and make sure that they feel comfortable with the security settings. For example, if one is using Google Chrome, a green lock will appear at the beginning of the address bar to symbolize a secure connection to that website. Lastly, the user can clear their history and their cookies often. The Internet is a fairly new tool that most people use and enjoy. The unfortunate part is that businesses and the government use this tool for their own gains. Most people are unaware of the problems with data mining. The next time that you are on the Internet check to see if your security settings align with your comfort levels.
