### TL;DR Most people use Google, but they do not realize what happens with their data once their search is done.

According to Alexa, Google.com is the most visited website on the world wide web. To have earned this title it is clear that people use google from their basic questions to their e-mails to their cravings for cute animals videos. But one thing people probably do not think about is "what happens after the search is over?"

Have you ever searched for shoes and a few hours later saw the same shoes as an ad on Facebook? This is an example of data mining.
